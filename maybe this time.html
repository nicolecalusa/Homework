    <p> Two old friends meet again, wearin' older faces</p>
        And talk about the places they have been</br>
        Two old sweethearts who fell apart somewhere long ago</br>
        How are they to know someday they'd meet again</br>
        And have a need for more than reminiscin'?</br>
</br>
        Maybe this time, it'll be lovin' they'll find</br>
        Maybe now they can be more than just friends</br>
        She's back in his life, and it feels so right</br>
        Maybe this time, love won't end</br>
</br>
        It's the same old feeling back again</br>
        It's the one they had way back when</br>
        They were too young to know when love is real</br>
</br>
        But somehow, some things never change</br>
        And even time hasn't cooled the flame</br>
        It's burnin' even brighter than it did before</br>
        It got another chance, and if they take it</br>
<br>
        Maybe this time, it'll be lovin' they'll find</br>
        Maybe now they can be more than just friends</br>
        She's back in his life, and it feels so right</br>
        Maybe this time, love won't end</br>
</br>
        She's smilin' like she used to smile way back then</br>
        She's feelin' like she used to feel way back when</br>
        They tried, but somethin' kept them</br>
        Waiting for this magic moment, oh, whoa</br>
        Maybe this time, it'll be lovin' they'll find</br>
        Maybe now they can be more than just friends, oh</br>
        She's back in his life, and it feels so right</br>
        Maybe this time, maybe this time</br>
        Maybe this time, love won't end</br>
